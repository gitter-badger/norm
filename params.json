{"name":"NORM","tagline":"You don’t need root to install anything","body":"# Norm\r\n\r\nDon't have root?\r\n\r\nNot a problem — `norm` installs stuff you need that your sysadmin didn't.\r\n\r\nAll you need is a working compiler.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/hmage/norm ~/norm\r\n. ~/norm/.bashrc\r\nnorm install gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter everything is done, you will have gcc 5.1 in `~/norm` with all it's dependencies, like this:\r\n\r\n![Example of gcc-5.1 output](http://hmage.github.io/norm/images/gcc-5.1.png)\r\n\r\nYou can add everything installed by `norm` into your `PATH` manually or you can use bashrc helper to do it for you — add this line to your `.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[[ -e ~/norm/.bashrc ]] && . ~/norm/.bashrc\r\n```\r\n\r\n## More examples\r\n * [`norm install gcc`](packages/gcc) — downloads, compiles and installs gcc 5.1. Great way to try out new compiler.\r\n * [`norm install ffmpeg`](packages/ffmpeg) — if you're on Debian wheezy, then your ffmpeg is _very_ outdated. This will gets you the newest ffmpeg with support for x264, x265, webm, opus and AAC.\r\n * [`norm install git`](packages/git) — similarly, your system copy of git might not support new features like push to deploy, reference cloning and shallow cloning.\r\n * [`norm install dovecot`](packages/dovecot) — you don't need root to spin up your own IMAP server, either. Change the listening port to something higher than 1024, set up virtual accounts and you're good to go.\r\n * [`norm install mc`](packages/mc) — latest midnight commander is much nicer than it was a few years ago, don't be stuck in the past.\r\n * [`norm install openssh`](packages/openssh) — your system openssh client might not support ECDSA and ed25519, which is increasingly problematic as the world around you moves away from DSA and RSA.\r\n * [`norm install fontconfig`](packages/fontconfig) — if font rendering on your machine looks horrible, install this, set up `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to `~/norm/lib` in your `.bashrc` (before interactive check cutoff) and restart X session.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\n`norm` installs packages to your home directory, leaving system-wide programs intact and untouched — you probably don't have permissions to change them anyway. By default, install prefix is `~/norm`, but you can change that. See output of `norm --help`.\r\n\r\nThe compiled binaries are not for distribution — they won't work on any other location or another machine (because most programs hardcode their paths during compilation and add checks to glibc version used for building).\r\n\r\nSince `norm` uses `curl` to download source code, it supports proxies. Just set up appropriate environment variables if you already haven't done so, like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport http_proxy=http://192.168.20.99:8080/\r\nexport https_proxy=$http_proxy\r\nexport ftp_proxy=$http_proxy\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace the IP address and port with appropriate values for your proxy. You can add this to your `.bashrc` if you haven't done so.\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n`norm` packages are bash scripts, [example](packages/tar):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ndepends_on libacl libattr\r\n\r\nfetch_source http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/tar/tar-1.28.tar.gz cd30a13bbfefb54b17e039be7c43d2592dd3d5d0\r\ndo_unpack_compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis particular packages uses only commands that are specific to `norm`:\r\n * `depends_on` — compiles the listed packages first.\r\n * `fetch_source` — downloads the source and verifies SHA1 checksum.\r\n * `do_unpack_compile` — unpacks the source code, runs `configure`, `make` and `make install`.\r\n\r\nIf software uses autotools to configure itself, no other bash functions are needed to successfully compile. [Other functions](norm_common.functions) should be self explanatory.\r\n\r\nTo see a more complex example, you can take a look at [how gcc is built](packages/gcc).\r\n\r\n## Adding new packages\r\n\r\nIf you want some package to be added to `norm`, you can either let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hmage/norm/issues) or you can do it yourself and then [open a pull request](https://github.com/hmage/norm/compare).\r\n","google":"UA-50765688-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
